# Partyseeker
> <sup> (2 min read) </sup>

**Partyseeker** is a website inspired by the Meetup social networking platform but focused on creating and sharing parties/celebrations/gatherings.

Like the eponymous title, this space is where party-making and sharing are ahead of the in-app experience. 🥳🎈

Composed of the central home view, we can search for the specific name of a party; or by city, country, or category.
Along with this section, we can search for matches by categories with their corresponding photographs. 📱

In each party view, we can see the written information of the party, title, and description, with the data formatted before in the Trix editor. ✒️

Next is the comments section, where we can create comments or reviews, and of course, the comment or review creator and the party owner can also delete with the delete button. 💬

Apart from this, there is a section with the map and the location information of the party, the date, and the time. 📍🗓️

In the top right corner, just above the party map, there is a button where you can confirm or cancel your attendance at the party.
And after the party information, there is a section where you can see the list of those interested users. 🙋🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️

Below this full view of the party information is the Nearby Parties section, listing the three nearest parties. 🗺️

The Main section, made for the party administration, allows you to edit the information, upload or update the party's image, or delete the specific party. 🥂🎁🪅✨

Then, in the navigation, you can add your personal information (name, biography, website) and a profile picture. 🧑‍🚀

The profile section collects the user's information to share with their parties and groups in the user's profile view.
There is also an area where you can change your password using the same method for account confirmation, checked via email. 📧

The attractive and cheerful design makes up the site in a colorful way from start to finish. 🐲🌈

A carefully designed and lovingly developed functional space to meet, cheer up, and enjoy with everyone. ❤️🌐
